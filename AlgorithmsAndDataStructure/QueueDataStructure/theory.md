# Queue Data structure
Queue is a kind of array where you can only insert items at the back and remove from the front. It is based on FIFO (first in, first out) principle.
Queue has three required methods:
* INQUEUE - insert new item at the back of the queue
* DEQUEUE - delete item which was inserted first (in other words it deletes first element in queue array)
* PEEK - check what the first element in a queue is.
