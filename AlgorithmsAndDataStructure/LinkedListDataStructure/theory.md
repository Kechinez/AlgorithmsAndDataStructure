# Linked List data structure
It is a sequence of data items, where each item is referred to as a node. To keep track where list begins and ends, usually 
there are two nodes called head and tail. Each new elementnode will be added at the end of linked list, right after tail node 
therefore new added node will become new tail node.
### There are two type of linked list:
* Singly linked list: linked list where each node only has next-node reference to next node
* Doubly linked list: linked list where each node has references to next and previous nodes
