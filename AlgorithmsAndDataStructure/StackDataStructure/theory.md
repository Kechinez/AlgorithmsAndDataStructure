# Stack data structure
Stack is a kind of array. Stack is based on LIFO (last-in first-out order) princple. It means that the last push element will be poped first. 
Stack can do three action: 
* PUSH - add new element on the top of the stack
* POP - remove the element which is currently on the top of the stack
* PICK - check what element is currently on the top of the stack
